# Introduction
Manifest is a Classic Role Playing Game (CRPG) development tool designed for a more intuitive game creation process.

## Benefits for Developers
Manifest provides significant advantages for both independent developers and established game studios:
- Build: A set like creating a lego set. Creating a set will be as easy as *adding* or *importing* a blueprint file or *modifying* a prefabricate one.
- Decorate: The pieces on the set and change their superficial look on real-time without worrying about messing other aspects of the set by accident.
- Play: With different playstructures prefabricated or custom made. Create, Remove, Update or Delete pieces from the space. 
- Arrage: Playpieces so they can be moved, resized, scaled and rotated.
- Clean: A set by bringing it back to a previous loaded scene. Manifest keeps your work safe by saving smartly.
- Repair: And mantain game pieces by debugging them and testing them independently from other pieces. Every gamepiece can be customized by the liking of the developers.
- Craft: New pieces by importing 3d assets or using the "template pieces" menu.
- Explore: Your own world and connect sets intuitively.
