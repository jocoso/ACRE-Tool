Active Reading Tool (ACRE Tool) for short, is a program designed to increase peopleâ€™s engagement in reading, by creating an unique way to engage with the stories that matches the interactivity of a videogame in book format.

For the ACRE Tool to be used, it requires a _**screenplay**_. A screenplay is a _\`.__screen__\`_ file that an author would write in Screenplay Language and give it to the ACRE engine to execute. The program uses an architecture that resembles the way theater organizes its productions in order to execute the screen play, such that we have a:
  
_A) Stage Manager: To deal with the intangible. (the story)_

_B) Props Manager: To deal with the tangible. (stage props, actors, sets, ...)_

**Stage Manager**

**\-------------------**

In theater, a stage manager is the one responsible for smooth operations of each person on stage. It works like the main hub of communication between the director, actors, and technical crew. The Stage Manager will serve as the logic of the app: the one that executes when the reader reads an ACRE story.

  

**The stage manager uses the script to create:  
**\- Enemy and NPC AI.  
\- All Important events.  
\- Rulebook  
\- Anything that is not tangible in the game.  
  
  

**The stage manager ensures:**

\- All assets are in working conditions.

\- The game is working well and efficiently.

\- None of the props or sets is returning an error.

\- Error handling during game play (reading).

\- Tells the prop manager when to quit.

  

**Prop Manager**

**\-------------------**

Following the same example, the prop manager is the one responsible for everything prop related including the windows the user executes.

  

**The prop manager uses the script to generate:**

\- All the props.

\- All the actors.

\- All the sets.

\- All the Commands

\- All the special effects.

\- All the music.

**The prop manager ensures:**

\- A GUI window opens without error.

\- The stage manager has all the tools it need to play a story.
